Created a Continuous Integration pipeline using Maven and Jenkins.
As soon as I make any changes in the code, the code will be pushed from Eclipse to GitHub.
Jenkins will then fetch the code from GitHub.
At last, Jenkins will make a build.
This process is fully automated. An automated build is triggered as soon as any changes are made in the source code.
